# Stellar Drift: Rogue Trader - Game Audit Report

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Ship Movement System** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Thruster visual not disappearing when mouse released
- **Root Cause**: State management timing issues between mouse events and rendering
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced thruster visual condition: `isThrusting = ship === player && isMouseDown && (Math.abs(thrustInput.x) > 0.1 || Math.abs(thrustInput.y) > 0.1)`
  - Immediate thrust reset on mouse up
  - Better state synchronization between mouse events and animation frames
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 2. **E Key Interaction System** ‚úÖ FIXED  
- **Issue**: E key only worked after opening/closing galaxy map
- **Root Cause**: Event listener focus management and callback dependencies
- **Solution**:
  - Multiple event listener attachment strategies (document + window)
  - Enhanced focus management with intervals
  - Stable callback functions with useCallback
  - Canvas auto-focus on component mount and mode changes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 3. **Asteroid Resources** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: No asteroids had mineable resources
- **Root Cause**: Galaxy generation using wrong commodity IDs
- **Solution**:
  - Added missing commodity types: `raw-metals`, `rare-earth`, `ice-crystals`, `energy-cells`
  - Increased resource spawn rate from 60% to 80%
  - Enhanced resource variety (30% chance of multiple resource types)
  - Increased asteroid count per system from 3-8 to 4-10
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 4. **Station Missions** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Stations had few or no missions
- **Root Cause**: Mission generation logic was incomplete
- **Solution**:
  - Guaranteed 2-5 missions per station
  - Diversified mission types: delivery, escort, combat, mining, exploration
  - Proper mission descriptions and requirements
  - Added cargo and target requirements for specific mission types
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 5. **Object Overlap Prevention** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Asteroids and stations spawning too close together
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented `findSafePosition()` algorithm with collision detection
  - Minimum distances: 200+ units for stations, 120+ units for asteroids
  - 50 attempts to find safe positions before fallback
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
